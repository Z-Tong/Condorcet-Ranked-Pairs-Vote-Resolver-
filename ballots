# The first line should begin with a *. This defines the list of
# candidates in the contest. (All on one line, separated by whitespace.)

# The remaining lines define ballots -- one line per voter.
  
DDD CCC BBB AAA
# This is a complete ballot. The voter ranked all four candidates,
# from DDD (best) to AAA (worst).

DDD AAA BBB
# This is an incomplete ballot. The voter only ranked three candidates;
# he didn't have any opinion about CCC at all. (This neither helps nor
# hurts CCC.)

DDD AAA/CCC BBB
# This ballot contains a tie. The voter liked DDD best, BBB least,
# and AAA and CCC tied for middle place. This is not the same as the
# previous ballot, because the voter *did* express opinions about CCC;
# he says CCC is better than BBB and worse than DDD.

CCC AAA/DDD/BBB
# This voter likes CCC best, but sees the other candidates as all
# equally bad. This ballot *does* hurt AAA, BBB, and DDD.

AAA
# This voter says AAA is... well, he isn't saying anything about AAA.
# This is legal, but pointless. It doesn't express any preferences
# at all, so it's the same as not voting.

AAA/DDD
# This voter ranked AAA and DDD as equal and ignores the others. This
# is also pointless; it doesn't favor any candidate over another.
